ALX Maze Project Overview
Introduction
Welcome to the alternative Maze project for the ALX Software Engineering program's "Research & Project Approval (Part 1)" course. The goal is to create a 3D game using raycasting!

Tasks Breakdown
1. Walls!

Objective: Create a window using SDL2 and use raycasting to draw walls.
Requirements:
Implement a window with SDL2.
Use raycasting to render walls.
Enable camera angle changes in the code (though no need for runtime rotation).
Ensure wall colors differ from ground and ceiling colors.
Provide a way to modify the map within the code.
2. Orientation

Objective: Color walls differently based on their orientation.
Requirements:
Use different colors for walls facing NORTH/SOUTH vs. EAST/WEST.
3. Rotation

Objective: Enable camera rotation during execution.
Requirements:
Rotate the camera using keyboard arrows or mouse movement (like in FPS games).
4. Movement

Objective: Enable camera movement during execution.
Requirements:
Move the camera using 'w', 'a', 's', 'd' keys.
5. Collisions

Objective: Handle player collisions with walls.
Requirements:
Prevent the player from entering walls.
Allow the player to slide along walls upon collision.
6. Parser

Objective: Implement a map parser.
Requirements:
Define map standards (e.g., characters for walls, empty spaces).
Run the program with the map file as a parameter.
7. Draw the Map

Objective: Display the map on the window.
Requirements:
Draw the map with customizable colors.
Enable/disable the map display during execution.
Include the playerâ€™s line of sight.
8. Coding Style & Documentation

Objective: Adhere to Holberton School coding and documentation standards.
Requirements:
Ensure code follows the required style.
Keep the repository clean with only necessary files.
9. Textures

Objective: Add textures to walls.
10. Multi-tasking

Objective: Handle multiple simultaneous movements and rotations.
Requirements:
Handle combinations of movement keys (e.g., 'w' and 'd' to move forward and right).
11. Ground Textures

Objective: Add textures to the ground and/or ceiling.
12. Weapons

Objective: Add weapon textures.
13. Enemies

Objective: Add enemies.
14. Weather Effects

Objective: Implement rain effects with toggle functionality.
15. Extra Features

Objective: Get creative with additional features like shadows or special lighting effects.
Good luck and have fun creating your 3D maze game!
